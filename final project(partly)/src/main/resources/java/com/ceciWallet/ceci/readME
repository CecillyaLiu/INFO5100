Hi! This is a small application written by Yixuan Liu. Thanks for your time to read this file.

My friends often call me Ceci and thus my application name is Ceci's Wallet, designed for personal money tracking.

There are totally 2 files, one is Main.java, you can run the whole application through this file.

The another one is MainView.java, containing 4 other classes.

accountPanel is the main panel for your account book, forgotPanel is for the case when you forgot your password and you need to find it back.

MainView is the main class and manage other classes. registerPanel is for user register, UserLogin is for user login.



Register or login to your account book!

You can choose expenses/income, which year and which month to see your bills. It's also available that you can choose "All" to see all bills in a whole year!

At the topper of the panel is the account book name, you can change it by clicking "Rename account book" button.

Then is the amount of bills under the conditions you choose, and the remaining budget.

If you haven't set the budget yet, it should be 0 and remaining budget could be negative or 0. Click the "Set Budget" button to change it. Note: it's monthly budget.



You can also add item into the account book by utilizing the bottom panel, just enter all the information of your expenses, and click "Add item".

Also you can delete item, but remember to choose it first.

"Clear" will clear the textfields.


Now it's time to try the application! Enjoy your time with Ceci's Wallet!
